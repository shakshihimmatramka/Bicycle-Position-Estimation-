# Bicycle-Position-Estimation-
Implemented Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate bicycle position and heading angle from uncertain dynamics and noise corrupted measurements. Tuned the estimator design characteristics for minimum error and tested them for the 100 use cases.

This Respitory consist of three branches. 
The master branch has the project report which summarize the prroblem statement, approach and results.
The other two branch consist of code for the problem statement using Extended Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter.
