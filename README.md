# Bicycle-Position-Estimation-
Implemented Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate bicycle position and heading angle from uncertain dynamics and noise corrupted measurements. Tuned the estimator design characteristics for minimum error and tested them for the 100 use cases.
